# fault-localization
Tarantula approach for fault localization using Python and Linux/Unix. Worked with a bug from the Closure open-source project contained in the defects4j collection from Github. Parses over 4 thousand XML files with code coverage analysis and collects information necessary for formula. Writes suspiciousness score of each line to a CSV file.
