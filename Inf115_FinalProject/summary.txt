First off, the lines that had high suspiciousness scores were the following:
lines 473, 474, 492, 494, 541, 542, 543, 1365, 1366, 1368, 1376, 1377, 1380, 1385, 1386, 1387, 1394, 1412, 1413 and 1414. I ran the command vimdiff in terminal that gave me visual information  of what changes were made in the fixed version compared to the buggy version. There was a change between lines 1409 and 1410. There was no high suspicious score for these 2 lines. There was also another change made between lines 1411 and 1412. Only the line 1412 had a high suspicious score while line 1411 had a score of 0. Lastly, there was a change made between lines 1412 and 1413. Line 1413 also had a high suspicious score. Since these lines were changed, it means that the bug was within those lines. The lines with the high suspicious scores did contain the bug. We can exclude the low scored lines because there was either a blank space or comment so it was obviously going to have a score of 0. One last interesting observation I made was that lines 473 and 474 had the highest suspiciousness score and there was no change made in those lines in the fixed version.
